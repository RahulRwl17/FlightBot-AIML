If you have a flight API to collect data from and user input, you can use the following approach to build your chatbot:

1. Collect user input: The first step is to collect user input. This can be done through a chat interface, where the user types in their question.

2. Extract intent: Once you have collected the user's input, the next step is to extract the intent of their question. You can do this using a pre-trained intent classification model or by training your own model on a dataset of questions and their corresponding intents.

3. Retrieve data from API: Once you have identified the intent of the user's question, the next step is to retrieve the relevant data from the flight API. For example, if the user asks "What is the status of my flight?", you can use the flight API to retrieve the current status of their flight.

4. Generate response: Once you have retrieved the relevant data from the flight API, the next step is to generate a response to the user's question. You can use a pre-trained language model like BERT to generate the response, or you can manually create a set of response templates and fill in the relevant data retrieved from the flight API.

Display response: Finally, you can display the generated response to the user through the chat interface.
